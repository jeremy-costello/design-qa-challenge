"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure. The battery structure is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document, can we use the battery structure in the vehicle?  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’).

The maximum stress observed in the structure appears to be near the red end of the scale, which corresponds to approximately 220 MPa. According to Rule F.3.5.3b, for non-welded aluminum tubing made of 6061-T6, the specified yield strength (Sy) is 240 MPa. The FEA result of 220 MPa is below the yield strength, indicating that the structure is not experiencing yielding under the applied load. This suggests that the design is within the safe operating range for the material under the assumed loading conditions. Additionally, since the structure is specified as non-welded, the lower yield strength of 240 MPa is appropriate for calculation purposes. No evidence of structural failure or stress exceeding the material’s yield strength is visible in the simulation. Therefore, the battery structure complies with the FSAE rule F.3.5.3b for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing.

The maximum stress observed in the structure appears to be approximately 260 MPa, which is significantly higher than the yield strength of 240 MPa specified for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing in Rule F.3.5.3b. This indicates that the structure is operating beyond its yield point under the applied load, which is not acceptable for safety and structural integrity in an FSAE vehicle. Even though the material is specified as non-welded and compliant with Rule F.3.5.3b, the FEA results show that the design is not safe under the expected loading conditions. Therefore, the structure cannot be used in the vehicle as it violates the fundamental requirement of not exceeding the yield strength of the material.

The provided image contains anthropometric data for both the smallest woman and the largest man who can be accommodated in the vehicle. However, the image does not show any FEA simulation results, material properties, or structural analysis related to the vehicle’s ability to support these anthropometric limits. Instead, it only presents static dimensional limits (e.g., standing height, hip width, foot length, etc.) for the smallest woman and largest man. Without knowing whether the vehicle’s structural design, materials, and FEA results can withstand the forces and stresses associated with these dimensions (e.g., seat fit, control reachability, safety constraints, etc.), we cannot verify compliance with Rule V.2.1.1. The rule also mentions that “accommodation includes driver position, driver controls, and driver equipment,” which implies functional and ergonomic compliance beyond just physical dimensions.

According to the rule, for this voltage range, the resistor value must be 10 kOhm, which matches the proposed resistor value. Therefore, the resistor sizing is compliant with the voltage range. Additionally, the rule requires that the resistor’s continuous power rating must exceed the power dissipated if the TSMPs are shorted together, which is a separate engineering calculation not provided in the image. However, since the resistor value is correctly sized for the maximum voltage observed, and the rule explicitly allows 10 kOhm for voltages up to 400 V DC, the resistor can be used. Furthermore, the rule requires the resistor to be directly measurable during Electrical Technical Inspection, which is a practical requirement that must be addressed in the design, but does not contradict the voltage-based sizing. Thus, the resistor is compliant with the rule’s requirements.

Therefore this assembly should not be used.","Explanation: The FEA result image displays a stress distribution across a welded steel frame assembly, with the color scale indicating stress in MPa, ranging from 0.00 to 250.00 MPa. Since the component is made from welded steel tubing, Rule F.3.4.2b applies, which specifies that for welded materials, the yield strength (Sy) for design calculations is 180 MPa and ultimate strength (Su) is 300 MPa. The maximum stress shown in the FEA is 250 MPa, which exceeds the yield strength of 180 MPa. This indicates that the component is operating in the plastic deformation regime, which is not acceptable for a structural component in a vehicle under FSAE rules. FSAE rules require that structural components must be designed to remain in the elastic region under all expected loads, meaning the maximum stress must not exceed the yield strength. Therefore, the assembly as shown is not compliant with FSAE rules for welded steel components.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculation of the stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal. Based on rule T.3.2.2 in the rule document, did we use correct inputs in our analysis? First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,11.png,The input force on the brakes is over the 2000 N required in the rules.,"Explanation: Rule T.3.2.2 specifies that the brake pedal and associated components must withstand a minimum force of 2000 N without failure. However, the rule explicitly states this is “not a design criteria” and that the brake pedal may be tested by pressing the pedal with the maximum force that can be exerted by any official when seated normally. This implies that the 2000 N value is not a mandatory design requirement but rather a reference or test condition for validation.

In the provided image and table, the input force F_in is 2500 N, and the calculated output force F_out is 384,838,585 N — which is clearly unreasonably high and likely an error (possibly a unit mistake or misapplication of the pedal ratio). The calculated max bending stress on the slats is 1.27e9 Pa (1270 MPa), which is far beyond the typical yield strength of common FSAE materials (e.g., 304 stainless steel ~200 MPa, aluminum ~250 MPa, or carbon fiber ~500–1000 MPa — but even then, 1270 MPa is extreme for most structural materials). The stress value implies catastrophic failure under the applied load, suggesting the analysis is flawed or the inputs are incorrect.

Furthermore, the table shows F_in = 2500 N, which exceeds the 2000 N minimum specified in the rule, but the rule does not require the component to withstand 2500 N — it only requires it to withstand 2000 N without failure. The analysis must be validated against the actual maximum force that an official can exert (which is not specified here), not an arbitrary 2500 N. The stress calculation is also likely incorrect because the input force should be the maximum force an official can exert (not 2500 N), and the stress should be evaluated at the actual maximum load condition, not a hypothetical 2500 N.

Therefore, the inputs used in the analysis (2500 N F_in) are not aligned with the rule’s intent, which is to ensure the component can handle the maximum force that an official can exert — not a higher arbitrary value. The analysis is not compliant with the rule’s intent.

The provided analysis calculates the maximum internal bending stress as 1,279,527,559 Pa (or ~1.28 GPa), which is a very high value and likely represents a stress concentration or localized stress due to the geometry and applied force. However, the input force used in the calculation is F_in = 1750 N, which is less than the 2000 N minimum requirement specified in the rule. While the output force F_out = 235,838,555 N is unrealistic (likely an error in calculation or unit conversion — possibly a misplacement of the “N” unit or a factor error), the critical point is that the applied input force used in the stress calculation (1750 N) is below the 2000 N threshold. Therefore, the analysis does not use the correct input force as required by the rule. The rule requires testing and design for 2000 N, not 1750 N. Additionally, the rule does not require FEA to be done with a force less than 2000 N — it must be designed to handle at least 2000 N. The FEA result should be validated against the 2000 N load, not the 1750 N used.

This means the component must not exceed 240 MPa in any region under operating conditions to remain within the elastic limit and avoid plastic deformation.

The maximum stress shown in the FEA result (362.13 MPa) exceeds the yield strength of 240 MPa, indicating that the component would experience plastic deformation under the applied load, which is not compliant with FSAE rules. Even if the material is 6061-T6 and non-welded, the design must be able to withstand stresses below the yield strength.
