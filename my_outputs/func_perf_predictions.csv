The maximum stress shown in the simulation is 220.00 MPa. According to Rule F.3.5.3b, for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, the minimum yield strength (Sy) for calculations in an SES (Structural Evaluation Specification) is 240 MPa. Since the maximum stress in the simulation (220.00 MPa) is below the specified yield strength (240 MPa), the structure is not yielding under the simulated load. This indicates that the stress levels are within the allowable limits defined by the rule for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Therefore, based on the FEA results and the specified rule, the battery structure complies with the FSAE requirement for non-welded aluminum tubing.

The maximum stress shown in the simulation is 260.00 MPa, which exceeds the 240 MPa yield strength specified in the rule. This indicates that the structure is being stressed beyond its allowable yield limit under the assumed loading conditions. Since the FSAE rules require that all structural components must be designed to remain within the specified material properties (including yield strength) for compliance, this structure would not meet the requirements of Rule F.3.5.3b. Therefore, the battery structure as modeled and simulated cannot be used in the vehicle under the current FSAE rules.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current.

The image shows the max voltage is in the 200 to 400 range, so a 10kOhm resistor will work.","Explanation: According to Rule EV.5.8.4, the resistor value for TSMPs must be selected based on the maximum TS voltage (Vmax). The rule specifies that for voltages between 200 V DC and 400 V DC, a 10 kOhm resistor is required. The provided graph shows the calculated TS voltage over time, which starts at 0 V and asymptotically approaches 400 V, reaching approximately 400 V at 6 seconds. Since the maximum voltage (Vmax) is 400 V, the rule requires a 10 kOhm resistor. The rule also requires that the resistor’s continuous power rating must exceed the power dissipated if the TSMPs are shorted together, and that the resistor value must be directly measurable during inspection. Assuming the team can meet these additional requirements (power rating and measurement capability), the 10 kOhm resistor is compliant with the rule for the given voltage profile.

The rule specifies: if Vmax is between 200 V DC and 400 V DC, a 10 kOhm resistor is required. The provided graph shows the calculated TS voltage over time, reaching a maximum value of approximately 580 V at 6 seconds, which is above 400 V DC. Therefore, a 10 kOhm resistor is not compliant with the rule for this scenario. The correct resistor value for a Vmax of 580 V is 15 kOhm, as specified for voltages above 400 V DC but not exceeding 600 V DC. Since the rule requires the resistor to be sized based on the maximum voltage, and the calculated maximum voltage exceeds 400 V, a 10 kOhm resistor is insufficient. Thus, using a 10 kOhm resistor would violate the rule.

The provided force-displacement curve shows a peak force of approximately 50,000 N (or 50 kN), which is below the 60 kN limit specified for standard honeycomb attenuators. Therefore, the attenuator meets the peak load requirement for a standard honeycomb type. Additionally, since the attenuator is specified as standard honeycomb, it must comply with the requirements for standard honeycomb attenuators, including attachment method (bonding per F.8.5.3), dimensions (200mm width x 100mm height per F.8.5.7), and being mounted forward of the front bulkhead (F.8.1.1). The curve also shows a relatively stable force after initial deformation, which is consistent with honeycomb behavior, and the displacement appears to be within reasonable limits for a standard attenuator. Since the peak load is below the 60 kN threshold, the attenuator complies with F.8.7.2.

The FEA shows that the maximum stress is 150 MPa, which is less than the yield strength. This assembly can be used.","Explanation: The FEA simulation results show a maximum von Mises stress of 150.00 MPa, as indicated by the color scale (red/yellow regions). According to Rule F.3.4.2b, since the frame tubes are made from welded steel tubing (a discontinuous material), the allowable yield strength for design calculations must be 180 MPa. The simulated stress (150 MPa) is below this allowable limit, meaning the component is not overstressed under the assumed loading conditions. Therefore, based on this FEA result and the rule, the design complies with the FSAE requirement for welded steel components. However, it is important to note that FEA results are only as good as the input assumptions (loading, boundary conditions, material properties, mesh quality, etc.). The team should also verify that the simulation accurately represents the actual operating conditions and that all welds are properly modeled and accounted for. Additionally, the team should ensure that the simulation includes all relevant load cases and that the safety factor (typically 1.5 for FSAE) is considered in the design process. Since the stress is below the allowable yield strength for welded steel (180 MPa), and assuming the simulation is accurate and complete, the assembly is compliant with the rule and can be used in the vehicle.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculation of the stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal.

Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,11.png,The input force on the brakes is over the 2000 N required in the rules.,"Explanation: Rule T.3.2.2 specifies that the brake pedal and associated components must withstand a minimum force of 2000 N without failure. The rule clarifies that this is not a design criterion but a test requirement, and the pedal should be tested with the maximum force that can be exerted by any official when seated normally. The FEA analysis shown uses an input force of 2500 N (F_in), which exceeds the 2000 N minimum specified in the rule. While the rule does not mandate that the design be analyzed for 2000 N specifically, it does require that the pedal withstands the maximum force an official can exert. Using 2500 N is reasonable as it represents a realistic upper bound for human input force, and since the rule allows for testing with the maximum force an official can exert, using 2500 N is compliant with the intent of the rule. The analysis correctly identifies the force applied by the driver (F_in = 2500 N) as the input force, and the calculated output force (F_out = 384.8385855 N) is derived from the pedal ratio (3.3) via the formula F_out = PR(F_in), which is consistent with the mechanics of a brake pedal system. Therefore, the inputs used in the analysis are correct and comply with the rule’s intent.

The rule clarifies that this is not a design criterion but rather a test condition: “The Brake Pedal and Brake System may be tested by pressing the pedal with the maximum force that can be exerted by any official when seated normally.” This implies that the test force should be based on the maximum force a human can exert under normal seated conditions, not a fixed 2000 N. The FEA analysis in the image uses an input force of 1750 N, which is less than the 2000 N threshold mentioned in the rule. However, the rule does not mandate using 2000 N as the input for analysis; instead, it defines the test condition. The 1750 N value appears to be a driver input force (possibly from a driver's maximum exertion, which may be less than 2000 N), and the rule does not specify that 2000 N must be used in analysis. Therefore, using 1750 N is not in violation of the rule, as the rule defines the test condition (not the analysis input) and does not prescribe a specific value for FEA. The rule’s intent is to ensure the system can withstand the force exerted by a human driver under normal seated conditions, which may be less than 2000 N. The analysis using 1750 N is acceptable if it represents a realistic human input force.

The Ring Gear reaches approximately 57°C and the Housing reaches approximately 53°C at 1600 seconds — but both are still above 60°C at the end of the test, and more critically, during the test, the Ring Gear reaches temperatures above 60°C (e.g., at 1500s it is ~57°C, but it is increasing and likely exceeds 60°C before 1600s). The Mill Bed remains at ~29°C, which is well below 60°C and irrelevant for driver contact.
