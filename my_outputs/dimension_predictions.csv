The drawing shows the front hoop braces 55mm from the top of the front hoop.,"Explanation: The engineering drawing shows a dimension of 26.59 mm from the top of the front hoop to the attachment point of the front hoop braces. This dimension is explicitly labeled and measured from the top-most surface of the front hoop downward. Since 26.59 mm is less than the 50 mm maximum allowed by Rule F.6.3.4, the design complies with the rule. The CAD views do not provide additional dimensions relevant to this rule, and no other dimensions contradict this measurement.

The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.7.1a specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules.

Since this dimension is explicitly shown and exceeds the allowable limit, the design does not comply with the rule.
Answer: no"
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.7.1a specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.",yes,T.7.7.1ac.jpg,scale,,"Explanation: The engineering drawing shows a side view of the vehicle with a total length dimension of 4000.3 mm. The rear aerodynamic zone is defined as the region behind the front axle and extending to the rear of the vehicle. The highest point of any aerodynamic device located in the rear aerodynamic zone must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground. In the engineering drawing, the rear wing and diffuser are clearly visible, and their highest points (e.g., the top of the rear wing) are shown to be approximately 1200 mm or less above the ground. The scale bar is not explicitly shown, but the drawing includes explicit dimensions and the CAD views confirm the height of the rear wing is within the 1200 mm limit. Therefore, the design complies with rule T.7.7.1a.

Answer: yes"
